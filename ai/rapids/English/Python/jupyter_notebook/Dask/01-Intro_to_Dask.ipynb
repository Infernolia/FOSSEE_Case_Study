    "Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python that makes scaling out your workflow smooth and simple. On the CPU, Dask uses Pandas (NumPy) to execute operations in parallel on DataFrame (array) partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask-cuDF extends Dask where necessary to allow its DataFrame partitions to be processed by cuDF GPU DataFrames as opposed to Pandas DataFrames. For instance, when you call dask_cudf.read_csv(…), your cluster’s GPUs do the work of parsing the CSV file(s) with underlying cudf.read_csv(). Dask also supports array based workflows using CuPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use Dask\n",
    "If your workflow is fast enough on a single GPU or your data comfortably fits in memory on a single GPU, you would want to use cuDF or CuPy. If you want to distribute your workflow across multiple GPUs, have more data than you can fit in memory on a single GPU, or want to analyze data spread across many files at once, you would want to use Dask.\n",

    "RAPIDS lets us scale up and take advantage of GPU acceleration. Dask lets us scale out to multiple machines. Dask supports both CuPy arrays and cuDF DataFrames, with generally the same APIs as the single-machine libraries. We encourage you to read the Dask [documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) to learn more, and also look at our [10 Minute Guide to cuDF and Dask cuDF](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/nightly/10min.html). After this brief introduction on Dask, we will learn how to use CuDF with Dask in detail in the next lab, and perform data operations on multiple levels."
